# TODO List for Fixing SecureStore Error and Upload Flow

## 1. Fix SecureStore Error in HomeScreen.js ✅
- Import Platform from 'react-native' ✅
- Modify checkAuth function to use AsyncStorage for web platform instead of SecureStore to avoid getValueWithKeyAsync error ✅
- Update fetchFiles to use axios defaults for token ✅

## 2. Update Upload Flow in UploadScreen.js ✅
- Remove the Alert.alert after successful upload ✅
- Directly navigate to 'Transform' screen with the uploaded file data after upload completes ✅
- Ensure loading animation (ActivityIndicator) remains on the button during upload ✅

## 3. Test Changes
- Run the app and verify SecureStore error is fixed on web ✅ (no more getValueWithKeyAsync error)
- Test upload flow: select file, upload with loading, direct navigation to Transform screen ✅ (fixed TransformScreen crash when no file is passed)
- Fix VisualizationScreen crash when no file is passed ✅ (added null check and fallback UI)
